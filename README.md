## Final Project: Group 1
- Our group create a recipe platform with react

### Set up the project environment on your local machine
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the project directory: cd frontend
- Run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies
- Start the development server with 'npm run dev'

### Notes:
- No need to install 'npm create vite@latest' and 'react-router-dom' since it is already listed as dependencies in 'package.json'
